                    This was a project that I did with two other students during my 1C03 (Engineering Design) class at McMcaster University. The goal of this project was to design a prosthetic hand that has two fingers using gears that would abide by certain restrictions given by the professor. These included certain measurements that the hand required, as well as certain gear ratios and a certain amount of revolutions that the handle had to be turned so that the two fingers would meet. The whole design was created using Autodesk Innventor, which is a 3D Mechanical Design software. Each of the Individual parts were then printed out using a 3D printer then assembled by hand.
