                    On March of 2019, I was invited to the Google Waterloo office to attend a special event called "Passport to Google", which was a special event for university students studying a STEM major to learn more about what it's like to work at Google! While I was there we had the chance to tour the Google Waterloo office as well as listen to some current Google Software Engineers talk about how their experience working at Google and how they got there.

                    I also had the opportunity to participate in a product pitching competition along with two other students to come up with a new Google product and pitch it to the Google Engineers (pictured above), which I thought was a really cool experience!
